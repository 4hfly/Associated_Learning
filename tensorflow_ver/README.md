# Associated Learning

Associated Learning modularizes neural network into smaller components, each of which has a local objective. 
Because the objectives are mutually independent, Associated Learning can learn the parameters at different components independently and simultaneously. 

See the following paper for details:

## Tested Environment
* Windows 10 (1903)
* Tensorflow 1.13.1 and 1.14.0

## Usage
Each folder contains a `main.py` and a `models.py`. The folder name corresponds to the experimental dataset.

Specifying the model you want to test with `--model` flag and run the following:
```bash
python main.py --model <MODEL>
```

For MNIST dataset, 4 models can be selected:
* MLP
* MLP_AL
* CNN
* CNN_AL

For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, 10 models can be selected:
* MLP
* MLP_AL
* CNN
* CNN_AL
* ResNet_20
* ResNet_20_AL
* ResNet_32
* ResNet_32_AL
* VGG
* VGG_AL
